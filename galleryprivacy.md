# Privacy Policy for Pure Gallery: Photo Vault

**Last Updated: January 3, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how Pure Gallery: Photo Vault ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

## 1. Information Collection and Use

### 1.1 Media Access
To provide the core functionality of a gallery app, we require access to your device's photos, videos, and media files. This access is used solely to display, organize, and manage your media within the App and to secure them in the "Photo Vault" feature if you choose.

### 1.2 Camera Access
If you enable the "Secret Snap" feature, the App may use your device's camera to capture photos of individuals who attempt to access your Secure Vault with an incorrect password/pattern. These photos are stored locally on your device and are not uploaded to our servers.

### 1.3 Biometric Data
If you use biometric authentication (e.g., Fingerprint or Face ID) to unlock your Secure Vault, the App leverages the device's secure biometric system. We do not collect or store your biometric data on our servers.

## 2. Third-Party Services

### 2.1 Advertising
We use third-party advertising services (e.g., Google AdMob) to display advertisements in the App. These services may collect and use information about your use of the App, including your device's advertising ID and network information, to serve personalized ads.

- **Storage/Media:** To access and manage your photos and videos.
